# Lambda Rust

Just a finished version of the [instructions for using AWS Lambda in Rust](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/rust-runtime-for-aws-lambda/) for my reference.

## Environment

- MacOS
- Cross compiling to linux via musl-gcc

## Dependencies

- musl-gcc, in instructions
- OpenSSL available on linker
- Maybe some other things I didn't capture previously
